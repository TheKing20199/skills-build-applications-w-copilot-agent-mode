## 🦾 Automated Accessibility Testing with Python (Selenium + axe-core)

You can use this script to check your app’s accessibility using Selenium and axe-core:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install selenium
   npm install axe-core
   ```
   (You’ll also need Chrome/Chromium and ChromeDriver installed.)

2. Save the following as `check_accessibility.py` in your project root:

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import json
import os

# List of URLs to check
URLS = [
    "http://localhost:8000/",
    "http://localhost:8000/submit-activity/",
    "http://localhost:8000/house/Kraken/",
    "http://localhost:8000/house/Montana/",
    "http://localhost:8000/house/Razor/",
    "http://localhost:8000/house/Serene/",
    "http://localhost:8000/leaderboard/",
]

AXE_PATH = os.path.abspath("node_modules/axe-core/axe.min.js")

def run_axe(driver):
    with open(AXE_PATH, "r") as f:
        axe_source = f.read()
    driver.execute_script(axe_source)
    result = driver.execute_async_script("""
        var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1];
        axe.run().then(results => callback(JSON.stringify(results)));
    """)
    return json.loads(result)

def main():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)

    for url in URLS:
        print(f"\nChecking {url}")
        driver.get(url)
        time.sleep(2)
        results = run_axe(driver)
        violations = results["violations"]
        print(f"Found {len(violations)} accessibility issues.")
        for v in violations:
            print(f"- {v['id']}: {v['help']} (impact: {v['impact']})")
            for node in v['nodes']:
                print(f"  Affected element: {node['html']}")
        print("-" * 40)

    driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. Start your Django server and run the script:
   ```sh
   python3 manage.py runserver
   python3 check_accessibility.py
   ```

This will print a summary of accessibility issues for each page. Use the output to fix issues and re-run as needed.

## 📧 Email Reminders (Push/Email Notifications)

- To enable real email reminders, update your `octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_backend/settings.py` with your SMTP credentials (see the EMAIL CONFIGURATION section for Gmail example).
- By default, emails print to the console for testing.
- To send daily reminders automatically, schedule the following cron job on Linux:

```
0 7 * * * cd /workspaces/skills-build-applications-w-copilot-agent-mode/octofit-tracker/backend && /usr/bin/python3 manage.py send_email_reminders
```

- To test email reminders manually (console backend):

```
cd octofit-tracker/backend
python manage.py send_email_reminders
```

- Users who have opted in (email_reminders enabled) and have not logged an activity today will receive a reminder.
